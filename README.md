# Recipe Scraper

A quick and dirty recipe scraper that uses [this](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers) recipe scraper
to quickly convert recipes online to json format.

Attempted to use gemini but got pretty inaccurate results.

Simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, put in a list of the recipes you want saved to `/recipes/` and 
run `python scrape-recipe.py` to get the json files.
